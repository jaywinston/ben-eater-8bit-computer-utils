be-as is a bash script. It is a toy implementation of Ben Eater's assembly
language for his 8-bit computer. It requires one file name as an argument.
Sorry, it doesn't read stdin. It's output is binary data on stdout so please
beware. It's output is intended to be loaded directly into the computer's
memory module. One way to do that it using Arduino as a loader with the
included ino file. With that file loaded into an Arduino Uno compatible unit,
the output of be-as can be redirected to a serial port connected to the unit
which will load the data into the computer.

Arduino interface:
A5 - write signal
2,3,4,5 - address lines, LSB pin 2
6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 - data lines, LSB pin 6

The write cycle is one second. That's just for demonstration. That can be
changed in the ino file by the FLASH_TIME and INTERVAL macros.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. Please examine the source code. This is just a toy
project that I did for fun as fast as I could in some spare time. There are
almost no checks for errors or data integrity.
